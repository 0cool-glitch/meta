# Rules

**1. No discriminatory or adult content.**
Swearing is allowed, so long as it isn’t malicious. Racism, sexism, and any other form of harassment or offensive comment is not permitted and will be met with punishment.

**2. No Spam.**
Spam clogs up the channels, and we will take action if you post a large number of messages in a short period of time or post long messages unnecessarily.

**3. Keep spam or shitposting to #overflow.**
`#overflow` is still subject to other rules - it is not a channel for NSFW content. However, spam, inappropriate discussions, and other content deemed to be unsuitable for other channels yet still maintainable on the server should be moved here. Mention spam is not acceptable.

**4. No spoilers.**
This server is for Cyber Discovery, but not for spoiling Cyber Discovery. By giving someone else answers you’re ruining the experience for everyone.

**5. No harassment.**
Be it sexual or verbal, harassment is not acceptable. This is any targeted action towards someone else with malicious intent.

**6. No unauthorised invite links.**
A list of authorised invite links can be found on [meta](#authorised-invite-links).

**7. No encouragement of illegal activity.**

**8. Appropriate channels should be used at all times.**
For example, memes belong in #memes not #general, and discussion of Cyber Discovery challenges belong in the appropriate CyberStart channels.

## Punishments

_Infractions are measured by severity and punished accordingly._

1. Adult Content/Doxing/Discrimination

Temporary(14 day)/Permanent ban. If the content is entirely unsuitable for the server, you will be banned. Doxing someone else is entirely unacceptable as well, as detailed in the doxing rules. Discriminating someone on the basis of sex, race, etc. will also be met with a ban.

2. Harassment - Temporary (14 day)/Permanent Ban.

Forms of sexual and verbal harassment are entirely unacceptable. Harassing another member on the server and ruining their experience is wrong, and, after being judged on a case-by-case basis, will be punished with a temporary or permanent ban.

1. Repeated Infractions, Consistent Spam - 3 hour mute.

If you receive 3 such mutes, this will escalate to a temporary ban of duration 7 days. If you make another serious infraction soon after this, you will be permanently banned.

4. Spam, Reposting Deleted Content - Warning, followed by 1h mute if continued.

3 of these counts as one 3h mute, and further punishments will be given accordingly. The 1 hour duration can be increased to up to 3 hours depending on whether the offence has been repeated or not.

Attempting to evade a sanction by using another account will result in that account being permanently banned. The originally punished account may also receive an increased sanction.

## Doxing

1. Do not expose any personal information about other people without express permission. Personal information is any info pertaining to their identity, e.g. locations, names, contact details - anything that is linked to that person.
2. Ask the person in question first. Do not do it if you’re not sure. Do not try and find information that can dox someone else either without their permission either.
3. Releasing your own information means it can be re-quoted. If you say something on the server, unless it is removed then anyone can re-quote it. If you want something deleted, ask a moderator. Do not harass someone else based on their information.

## Suggesting Changes to the Community

If you feel that something on the server could/should be improved, make an issue on the meta repository at <https://github.com/CyberDiscovery/meta/>. This is a platform for constructive discussion around the future of our community - however, this is not the place to appeal punishments or to report moderators so please see below.

## Reporting a Moderator/Appealing Punishments

If you have a serious complaint to make about a moderator, then DM an @Root in order to get this addressed. Please do not DM unless entirely required. Do not harass a moderator about decisions they make - **we reserve the right to make decisions not covered entirely by these rules if the situation requires it.**

Moderators are @Root and @Sudo and are here to answer any queries you may have in DMs. We can also be DMed in order to appeal punishments. Please note that we are not Cyber Discovery staff - any personal queries regarding the program should be sent to support@joincyberdiscovery.com, not us. If you have any enquiry to make around the above rules, or wish to discuss a punishment or deletion, we will be happy to discuss the exact reasoning in DMs. Harassing moderators is not on - we are people as well, and any sort of malicious activity towards us, will be met with appropriate punishment.
